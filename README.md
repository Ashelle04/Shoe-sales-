# Shoe Dataset Analysis

This R script analyzes a dataset of shoes, focusing on various attributes such as color, brand, and prices. The dataset contains information about different shoe models, their colors, brands, and corresponding prices.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Most Expensive Black Shoe
Identifies the most expensive shoe with either partial or full black color and provides details on the brand and cost.

### 2. Brand with the Most Expensive Shoes on Average
Determines the brand that, on average, offers the most expensive shoes. It involves standardizing the brand names and calculating mean prices.

### 3. Lowest Average Price by Color
Compares the average prices of shoes in colors red, blue, and white to identify which color is associated with the lowest average price.
